# Simpson Comments

This project was created as an assignment for a job interview. I learned a lot and enjoyed creating it.

Messages can be added either as stand alone or by clicking on an existing message you'll be in responding mode. Clicking anywhere outside the messages will revert back to a regular message post. The response messages are rendered recursively. 

The app is responsive for better display on mobile devices.
